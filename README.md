Unblur Scribd image page with simple userscript.

### Getting started

First you need to install either one of these user-script add-ons for your browser:

* [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) for Firefox
* [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) for Chrome

Then open [this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gvoze32/scribdunblurer/master/scribdunblurer.user.js) to show Install dialog.
